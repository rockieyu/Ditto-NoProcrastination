> ## Project Summary 
Our project aims to motivate study procrastinators to start their assignments through the use of moderate pressure and an offline study atmosphere. Users are expected to feel urgent by viewing classmates' study status and to-dos on the calendar. They can also find nearby classmates and suitable study places together. 

Focus on
- Study procrastination
- Wake people up from the ‘idle/lazy’ mode. 
- Possibility of group

Expected Experience 
- Slightly Urgent. _“Wow, these are all my deadlines? few days left, better do it now"_
- Companion.  _" I can probably discuss this assignment with my classmate"_
- Ease-to-use. _No more tutorial should be included. Suitable for lazy procrastinators._

Key functions
- Deadline Management
    - Clear to see and view 
    - Include all the necessary information (e.g. Link to Brief, percent)
    - Easy to manage (import, complete, check-done) 
- Study Atmosphere 
    - Discover nearby classmates, provide study atmosphere.
    - Recommend suitable learning places.
    - Encourage offline co-study.
    - Moderate Pressure, see friends' learning status roughly
